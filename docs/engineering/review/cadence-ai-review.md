# Cadence AI Review Automation

Cadence AI Review is the mandatory automation lane for Symphony-managed PRs.
The normal gate is the shared `symphony` label; PR-open and synchronize events
from `example-symphony-bot` to its own open PR may run before that label is applied
so the open-then-label race does not drop the first bot-authored update. Cadence reviews
the PR against its Linear acceptance criteria and linked design docs before human
review. Its automated scope is Symphony-managed PRs. It is separate from
ordinary human PR review and from the general review-agent methodology.

The review logic lives in the `cadence-ai-review` skill
(`.claude/skills/cadence-ai-review/`). The GitHub workflows provision
credentials and run Claude Code against that skill. Cadence writes detailed
review state to one Linear comment headed `## Cadence Workpad`, then posts one
concise GitHub PR review per completed pass (`APPROVE` when clean, otherwise `COMMENT`;
never `REQUEST_CHANGES`).

## Acceptance contract

Normal human handoff requires passing required CI and a fresh Cadence review of
the current PR head, a closed mandatory-feedback ledger, a clean task branch,
and a PR marked ready from draft. The Claude runner publishes `APPROVE` when
there are no blocker or human-needed findings, otherwise `COMMENT`. Record the
reviewer, reviewed SHA, verdict and matching Cadence workpad. Human approval and
merge own final acceptance; Cadence approval does not replace required human
branch-protection approval.

Read the required CI checks from the target's selected-base `.symphony.cfg.json`
and branch rules. Verify the current head, workflow/event/ref, emitting App,
applicable run attempts and required child jobs. Missing, ambiguous, pending,
stale, failed, canceled, timed-out or skipped results do not pass. Routing and
review jobs do not implicitly become required product CI.

The timeline helper reports `fresh-approval` or `stale-approval`; a changed head
or review-relevant activity after approval requires another review. Read human
feedback across submitted reviews, conversation comments, inline threads/replies
and Linear comments. Incomplete timeline history requires a full review.
Preserve stable finding IDs and workpad history, and close mandatory feedback
before handoff. Agent-only review loops stop after three passes; verified
human-grounded activity can reset the loop, while generated bookkeeping cannot.
A cap or human-needed finding requires a concrete human handoff, not a clean
acceptance claim.

Apply `mature` to the blocker only at normal readiness. Remove it for
request-changes, rejected or stale acceptance evidence, or a similarly severe
regression that makes dependent work unsafe. Ordinary edits alone do not revoke
maturity. Source availability does not prove installation or live execution;
record those refs and results separately.

## PR Actor Flow

Symphony implements and reworks issues in `Active`. Pending CI waits in
`Unhappy` with `wake:15m`; Cadence review, human review and missing input wait
in `Inactive`. The diagram names
actor phases; those phases are not additional required Linear states.

```mermaid

```

The [project workflow](../symphony/project-workflow.md) defines current-team
fallbacks. The DEMO team has `Active` and `Inactive`; review bridges use legacy
`Rework` only on teams missing `Active`. Human or accepted merge automation owns
the terminal `Done` transition.

### GitHub Review Handoff Contract

The next actor should be visible through GitHub events wherever possible,
rather than through hidden Symphony or Cadence-only decisions:

- Symphony PR opens, Symphony commits, human PR comments, human PR reviews,
  inline review comments, and ready-for-review events call the existing reviewer
  after the router verifies eligibility and the original feedback author's write
  permission. The Actions run shows queued, running and completed review work.
- A `pull_request_target.review_requested` event whose requested reviewer is
  `example-cadence-bot` invokes the single-PR Cadence review workflow. Review
  requests for other reviewers do not invoke Cadence.
- Cadence posts an `APPROVE` PR review when the current head has no blocker or
  human-needed findings. The Cadence review-submitted workflow then requests
  human review from the PR assignee. If no eligible PR assignee exists, it
  records a visible routing gap instead of requesting a broad human team.
- Cadence posts a `COMMENT` PR review when the current head has actionable
  findings or needs human input. The `cadence-linear-rework.yml` workflow moves
  the linked Linear issue to `Active` for actionable findings and requests
  eligible human PR assignees for human-needed findings. A human-review request
  leaves Linear state unchanged; Symphony records missing decisions in its
  workpad and waits in `Inactive`.
- Human non-approved review summaries with content, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
  reviews, and nonempty top-level PR comments also wake the linked issue
  directly. Human `APPROVED` reviews do not directly wake Linear, but still
  run Cadence so a human approval with notes receives a Cadence re-look.
- Human reviewers own final merge readiness. Cadence approval is advisory and
  does not satisfy branch-protection human approval requirements.

## Dispatch And PR Selection

The event bridge and manual PR matrix both call
[the existing reviewer](../../../.github/workflows/cadence-ai-review-trigger.yml)
through GitHub's native `workflow_call`. Normal routing does not remove and
re-add a bot review request. The reviewer already reads current PR state, runs
Claude, updates its workpad and applies its existing review cap and handoff.

Events first run the secret-free `cadence-review-ingress.yml`. Its JSON title
contains selectors, never authority. The `workflow_run` consumers execute on
trusted `main`, read current PR/feedback through `actions/github-script`, and
verify the original author's write permission. A failed or denied router cannot
start the dependent review job. Keep `cadence-controller` restricted to `main`.

The reusable call retains the caller's event and actor. GitHub-identified bot
initiators may enter the provider's bot allowlist; humans still pass the provider's
independent write-permission check. Reviews use the configured publishing
credential. Only three named repository secret values are passed. Both callers
also name `CADENCE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` with an empty value, and the reusable workflow
declares it optional at the call boundary. The review job's protected
`cadence-controller` environment supplies the signing key, overriding that empty
value. Do not use `secrets: inherit` or copy the key into repository secrets.
See [GitHub's reusable workflow secret rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/reuse-automations/reuse-workflows#using-inputs-and-secrets-in-a-reusable-workflow).
Manual calls and legacy review requests
retain their existing actor checks. All review execution requires `refs/heads/main`.

GitHub's repository/PR concurrency group keeps one active review and queues up to
100 pending reviews (`queue: max`), preserving distinct feedback during review.
Closing or merging a PR cancels that group. Review planning also checks that the
PR is still open, so delayed events cannot restart it. Unchanged
duplicate events may still cause another review. The reviewer reacquires
current state; its outcome verifier rejects missing or stale-head reviews.

Manual `cadence-ai-review.yml` accepts `pr_numbers` (comma/space separated),
`review_label`, or both, then calls the reviewer once per selected PR. Direct
single-PR dispatch and `review_requested` remain compatibility entry points.
The stale-approval fallback runs inside the reviewer.

CI wakeups and `cadence-linear-rework.yml` keep their existing responsibilities.
There is no second CI evaluator, Linear state machine or human-invitation engine.
Review execution uses Claude. Deployment evidence includes an authorized
feedback event, an unauthorized author, and a manual selection, with Actions
links and actual handoff results. Local tests do not prove live environment
admission or provider execution.

## Automated Triggers And Manual Fallbacks

Automated Cadence review is label-gated and actor-gated:

- A human-facing PR comment, PR review, inline review comment, or
  ready-for-review event can call Cadence when the PR has the
  `symphony` label.
- A review request targeting `example-cadence-bot` invokes the single-PR trigger
  workflow. Non-Cadence reviewer requests do not invoke Cadence.
- A `pull_request_target.opened` or `pull_request_target.synchronize` event from
  `example-symphony-bot` to its own open PR can request Cadence review so Cadence
  reviews new Symphony PRs and commits; the label gate is waived only for this
  bot-authored open/update request path.
- Cadence, Claude, dependency bots, generic `[bot]` actors, closed PRs,
  non-Symphony PRs, and PRs without the `symphony` label outside the bot
  open/update race do not queue review. The router records the reason in the
  Actions summary.
- Human feedback enters the same Cadence/Symphony review loop regardless of
  GitHub review state. Humans do not need to use GitHub's formal
  `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review state; a human comment without approval is de
  facto a request for more work until Cadence re-looks and the next actor is
  explicit.
- Cadence review loop labels (`cadence-loop-N`) are advanced by the single-PR
  workflow. Human-grounded activity resets the next run to `cadence-loop-1`;
  agent-only continuation stops at the configured cap and requests review from
  the PR assignee with the concrete reason in the Cadence workpad. When
  Symphony and Cadence are quiescent with no review-relevant changes, the
  workflow requests the assigned human next actor instead of asking Symphony to
  retry without an action. If there is no eligible PR assignee, the workflow
  records a visible routing gap rather than falling back to a broad human team.

Manual fallbacks remain part of the contract. A human can dispatch the manual
group workflow to re-request Cadence, use the single-PR trigger's direct
dispatch as a break-glass retry, or route Linear state manually when a
credential, team-lookup, or issue-linking problem prevents the automation from
making an authoritative decision.

## Required Configuration

Set these values in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets.
Required when using the workflow that consumes them; there are no credential
defaults. All values come from adopter-owned accounts. Never commit them.

Human feedback routing and the single-PR review trigger require the protected
`cadence-controller` Environment's `CADENCE_APP_ID` variable and
`CADENCE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secret. See the
[App permission requirements](./github-actor-classification.md#app-installation-and-rollout).

Repository secrets:

- `CADENCE_AI_REVIEW_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Claude API key for the review.
- `CADENCE_BOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`: the legacy reviewer/trigger bot's GitHub token (classic, `repo`
  scope). Used for the legacy review action's `github_token` and its publishing
  calls. Human feedback acquisition and permission checks use the existing
  Cadence App installation token instead. The bot account has **Triage**
  repository access, so its approvals do not count toward required reviews.
- `CADENCE_LINEAR_API_TOKEN`: Linear API token used by
  `scripts/fetch-linear-issue.mjs` to read issue context, by
  `scripts/cadence-linear-workpad.mjs` to write the Cadence workpad, and by the
  review workflow when optional Linear-side Cadence state can be written.
- `GOOGLE_SA_KEY`: a Google service-account JSON key. Staged to a file and read
  by `scripts/fetch-google-doc.mjs` to export linked design docs.

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: the AWS access-key ID and
  paired secret used only by the host AMI workflow. Supply a principal authorized
  to inspect images in the configured account. These are separate from Cadence's
  review credentials and from the host's AWS Secrets Manager JSON bundles.

Set repository variables in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
Variables. Identity values must name the accounts behind the supplied tokens:

- `SYMPHONY_BOT_USER`: coding bot GitHub login. Required for live attribution;
  synthetic fallback `example-symphony-bot`.
- `CADENCE_REVIEWER`: review bot GitHub login. Required for live review;
  synthetic fallback `example-cadence-bot`.
- `SYMPHONY_REPOSITORY_OWNER`: GitHub organization slug used for team lookup.
  Optional in workflows (default: `github.repository_owner`); export it for
  standalone helpers, whose fallback `example-org` is synthetic.
- `CADENCE_GIT_EMAIL`: review bot commit email for the AMI workflow. Required
  for real attribution; synthetic fallback `example-cadence-bot@users.noreply.github.com`.
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: 12 decimal digits identifying the host account. Required
  for the AMI workflow; no default.
- `SYMPHONY_HUMAN_LEAD`: GitHub login to assign AMI update PRs. Optional; default:
  unset (no assignee).

Review model variable:

- `CADENCE_CLAUDE_MODEL`: required Claude model for the review. The trigger
  preflight approves `claude-opus-5` for the Opus 5 review requirement and fails
  before Claude runs when the variable is unset or points to an unapproved
  model.

## Identities

- **Review bot**: the account named by `CADENCE_REVIEWER` authors reviews via
  `CADENCE_BOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`. `example-cadence-bot` and `cadence@example.invalid`
  are synthetic login/contact examples.
- **Google service account**: its own `<service-account>@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com` email reads
  design docs. Share each doc, folder, or shared drive with that email as
  Viewer. This is a distinct identity from the GitHub bot.
- **Linear API token**: reads ticket context and writes the Cadence workpad.

## Actor Authority

For design decisions, a human with verified repository write access is
authorized to amend accepted designs and execution contracts. No separate
design-owner, project-lead, or team ratification is required. Record the decision
and superseded criteria in the workpad; Symphony updates the affected artifacts
and implements and commits. A stale design document or contrary AI preference
is not a missing human decision. See the
[replanning guide](../symphony/replanning.md#human-design-authority).

Actor classification below identifies humans and bots for event routing; it
does not reserve design authority to a named human or team. If event delivery
excludes a verified human writer, report that as a routing configuration gap,
not a requirement for a design owner to decide again.

Cadence and Symphony use the
[GitHub Actor Classification](./github-actor-classification.md) contract to
identify human-facing, AI, dependency-bot, and unknown activity. Classification
alone does not authorize work. The event router and review handoff verify the
current content author and effective repository write access through GitHub's
permission API before human feedback can request review or wake Symphony.
Read, triage, missing, malformed, and unavailable permission evidence is denied.
The check covers summaries, conversation comments, inline comments, and edits;
no sender, team, allowlist, association, or prose substitutes for permission.

Verified human writers can supply rework and design decisions directly, without
another design-owner approval. GitHub feedback acquired for later review stays
marked untrusted unless its author's current access passes the same check.
Unknown and bot content cannot reset the human review loop.

## What It Reads

For each PR: title, body, base, head SHA, changed files, diff, labels, CI status
(via `gh`). The associated Linear issue's description, acceptance criteria, and
comments (via `scripts/fetch-linear-issue.mjs`, read-only). Design and
requirement docs linked from the Linear issue or PR body, including Google Docs
(via `scripts/fetch-google-doc.mjs`).

Cadence reads the `## Codex Workpad` when a re-review needs Symphony execution
context, such as claimed fixes, validation evidence, deferred decisions, or
human feedback already handled by the coding agent. It reads that workpad as
input only; Cadence does not edit Symphony's workpad.

Both acquisition helpers are dependency-free and run with bare `node` locally
and on the runner, so the review reads the same way in both environments.
For docs/process PRs that touch workflow docs, agent instructions, checked-in
skills, runtime-bundle docs, or standing operational docs, Cadence also loads
`scripts/symphony/runtime-bundle/review-axes/standing-docs-current-state.md`.
Process requirements and design PRs use `cadence-ai-review`; the UI-focused
`.claude/skills/design-review/SKILL.md` skill is not the process reviewer.

## Output

Cadence has two output surfaces with different audiences:

- **Linear `## Cadence Workpad`**: detailed review state for Symphony and future
  Cadence runs, written through the
  [Cadence Linear Workpad](./cadence-linear-workpad.md) helper.
- **GitHub PR review**: concise human-readable assessment for PR reviewers.

The Linear workpad owns run status, trigger source, review decision, head SHA,
last-reviewed SHA and timestamp, prior or pending rerun state, skipped or
ignored events, requirement coverage, detailed findings, human-feedback learning
notes, and AI-to-AI coordination.

Symphony treats the Linear workpad as Cadence's durable handoff. Before
performing Cadence-driven rework, deciding that no Cadence action remains, or
summarizing review state for a human, Symphony should read the current
`## Cadence Workpad` instead of reconstructing Cadence state from GitHub review
text alone.

The GitHub review owns the concise assessment for the reviewed head, with the
reviewed SHA and workpad link. Each completed pass explains why the PR is
acceptable, blocked, or needs human input. Earlier reviews remain in GitHub
history; the single Linear workpad is updated in place.
Line-specific findings may use inline review comments when the exact location
helps a human reviewer act. Raw coverage tables, skipped-event detail, and
scratchpad reasoning stay on Linear.

The review event is chosen by findings: `APPROVE` when the PR has no `blocker`
and no `human-needed` findings, otherwise `COMMENT`. `REQUEST_CHANGES` is never
used. Posting output as PR reviews (not plain conversation comments) keeps the
event surface `pull_request_review`.

The reviewer bot has **Triage** (not Write) repository access, so its `APPROVE`
shows as an approval signal but does **not** count toward branch-protection
required reviews; a human approval is still required to merge. (Confirmed: a
Triage-role classic token can post reviews via the API.)

Reviews are submitted from one verified context. In a fan-out, workers return
review bodies and the orchestrator posts after confirming `gh api user` matches
the reviewer identity. A mismatch, such as a token falling back to another
login, aborts the review submission.

## Human Review And Follow-Up Routing

Cadence is advisory. Human reviewers and the project human lead own final review
judgment, priority, and merge readiness. The automated human handoff requests
eligible PR assignees only. It does not
fall back to the Linear issue assignee, project lead, or a broad human team.
If none is eligible, it records a routing gap in Linear for manual handling.

Verified human-writer feedback is authoritative Symphony input. Symphony can act on direct human
GitHub review feedback without waiting for Cadence to restate it. Cadence should
still receive post-human-review events and re-look unless the state fetch shows
the current Cadence review is still fresh. Cadence adding no findings is
expressed as an `APPROVE` review and `## Cadence Workpad` handoff, not as silent
retry pressure on Symphony.

`pull_request_target` workflow definitions are evaluated from the repository's
default branch. A PR that changes the Cadence review-request trigger cannot
fully dogfood that new trigger until the workflow lands on `main`; use the
workflow's static tests and, if needed, a break-glass manual dispatch to validate
the new trigger before merge.

When human feedback reveals the same class of issue elsewhere in the PR, a
reviewer-facing documentation gap, or an in-scope requirement gap, Cadence may
record human-grounded follow-up:

- **Mandatory follow-up** is directly grounded in human feedback and needed to
  resolve the same issue class, reviewer clarity gap, or in-scope requirement
  gap. Route it as `blocker` or `human-needed`, and put enough evidence in the
  Linear workpad for Symphony to perform Linear-driven rework.
- **Optional follow-up** is nice-to-have, speculative, or beyond the current
  issue's required outcome. Route it as `should-fix` or `suggestion`, label it
  non-blocking if mentioned on GitHub, and keep the detailed rationale in the
  workpad.

The single-PR workflow tracks Cadence review loops with `cadence-loop-N` labels
and a current cap of 3. Agent-to-agent continuation stops before runner
allocation when a Symphony push arrives on a PR already carrying
`cadence-loop-3`; the trigger workflow keeps the same cap as defense in depth
for direct and matrix invocations. Human comments and reviews always route
through and reset the loop back to `cadence-loop-1`.

## Request-Changes Enforcement

Three layers keep `REQUEST_CHANGES` off:

1. The skill restricts the event to `APPROVE` or `COMMENT`.
2. The workflow appends a system prompt repeating that constraint.
3. A post-run audit step (`Block request-changes reviews`) dismisses any
   `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review authored by the bot on a target PR and fails the
   job.

## Linear Write-Back

Cadence writes detailed review state only to the single Linear issue comment
headed `## Cadence Workpad`. It does not create ad hoc Linear comments and does
not edit `## Codex Workpad`.

The `## Codex Workpad` remains Symphony-owned execution state. Cadence may read
it during re-review to understand Symphony's latest reasoning and evidence, but
any Cadence assessment, skipped-event detail, rerun state, or AI coordination
must be written back to `## Cadence Workpad` or the concise GitHub PR review as
described above.

The Cadence review skill and event/trigger workflows do not change Linear issue
labels, assignees, relations, or project metadata. `cadence-linear-rework.yml`
is the narrow review state-transition companion. It wakes `Active` for
actionable Cadence output, nonempty human PR conversation comments, non-approved
human review bodies, and human changes-requested reviews after verifying human
writer permission. It requires an open,
Symphony-authored PR with the `symphony` label. Human approvals do not directly
wake Linear. Clean Cadence approval and human-needed findings request eligible
PR assignees without changing Linear state. Symphony owns the `Inactive` wait
and records the current checks and next actor.

The shared wakeup helper prefers `Active`, uses only `Rework` as a legacy
fallback, and fails when neither exists. It preserves `Done`, `Canceled`,
`Cancelled`, `Duplicate`, and terminal Linear categories. The review bridge
pins a writable Cadence workpad and re-reads issue state before waking. It
records actual state/mutation results, actor, reason, PR/head, event id, and run
URL in `coordination.reviewHandoff` and the workflow summary. Independent writers
are not atomic; skipped or failed writes are reported rather than treated as
confirmed transitions.

The [non-review bridge](../symphony/project-workflow.md#github-event-bridges)
shares those wakeup semantics for required-check failures, merge conflicts, and
issue-scoped workflow completions. If Cadence cannot identify the linked Linear
issue or lacks the required Linear token for an optional workpad write, it
reports that visibly instead of guessing.

For a dispatched workflow on a `symphony/` branch, adopters may set their
workflow's top-level `run-name` to begin with `[linear:<issue>] `, followed by a
description. The marker must contain one valid issue identifier and a trailing
space after the closing bracket. This optional marker identifies the issue when
the completion payload has no dispatch inputs or linked PR; it takes precedence
over the PR title and branch. Without it, the bridge resolves the PR title, then
the branch, and rejects missing or ambiguous identity. The extraction supplies
the consumer only; adopters choose whether their own workflows produce this
marker. A marker does not enable completion routing from a non-Symphony branch.

## Slack

Slack notifications are deferred. This workflow does not reference Slack secrets
and does not send Slack messages.
